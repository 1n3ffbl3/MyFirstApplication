## Description

Goal of our application is to design and provide easier way of communication between people and organizations who want to help others. It is often the case that the people that want to help struggle to do that due to many circumstances. Let's consider following scenario:

"
  Brave people who wanted to help, were looking for a humanitarian organization. They have called them to know, which needs are currently demanding, i.e. products like diapers. As people have heard about that, they have bought diapers and they went to the organization office location. At the office, a member said, that they have already too many diapers, but now the blankets are in demand.
"  

As you can see, there is lack of communication between the people that are willing to help, and the organisations themselfs. 
Here comes our application, as it is designed to fill the missing gap of communication! We will provide a simple tool to make the commucation easier than it ever was. Organisation will be able to organise new events for gathering goods or needs and people will be able to assist and offer their help. Therefore we will reduce the chance of mistakes as we could read in the scenario above.
Moreover private persons will be able to offer their help for the community (i.e. shelter for refugee).

## Solution Explanation

Explain your solution in detail, however works for you.  Perhaps by using a specific input to illustrate, by describing your strategy, or by including a diagram [directly from Sketchboard.io](https://sketchboard.io/blog/2014/03/06/github-sketchboard.html).

## Constraints

What constraints did you place on yourself, and why?  Did they end up being helpful or not?

Marta : 
1. Firstly sketch website on paper then create it
2. Write use cases befor implementing logic
3. Improve technical vocabulary


In this application, we have to consider three types of users :
* private user
* user as an organisation
* member of an organisation
Each of them have different actions in our application, as you can see it above in our use cases

## Resource Estimation

Estimate how what resources you will require, and how much of each.  

1. Team resources and availability: 
  * two developers (1 full time and the other part time)
  * one mentor (2 hours per week)
  * one teacher (6 hours per week)

2. Requirements:
* demo of the application - 3 weeks of development
* error analysis - 2 hours per week
* consulting with users (at last 5 people) - 1 week 
* feedback gathering - 2 days
* analysing feedback  - 1 day
* implementing feedback - 1 week
* presentation of first version of the application

## Challenges & Bugs

The biggest challenge for me was to create an application from scratch. 

Challenges which required learning:
- javascript
- html
- css
- debugging
- MVC
- vue js 
- promises
- how to query API / "consume API"
- node js (libraries: express, cors, body-parser)
- endpoints (request type, information transfer)

Bugs:
- array methods (wrong understanding of methods behaviour)
- API (wrong request type, reading request params, sending parameters)
- javascript syntax (sign for comparision vs. sign for assignment)
- inheretance in js 
- arrow functions
- promises

  * Arrow functions
  * Test libraries (tinytest, mocha)
  * JS libraries (lodash)
  * Framework (vue js)
  * Scoping  (diffrence between var & let)

## Learning Journal

Things I learned doing this project: 
  * team work
  * planning 
  * task and time scheduling 
  * visualization of problems (sketching)
  * problem solving
  * information research
  * error analysis
  * testing
  * debugging

New vocabulary:
  * MVC (Model View Controller)
  * promises
  * arrow function
  * API (Application Public Interface)
  * class
  * service
  * dependency
  * predicate
  * callback

Things I struggled with:
  * debugging
  * time management
  * promises
  * callbacks
  * data storage
  * routing

Lessons to apply for next time:
  * better knowledge of html/javascript syntax
  * more debugging
  * more intensive testing
  * looking to more efficient libraries to work with
  * learning about others frameworks (i.e. react js)
